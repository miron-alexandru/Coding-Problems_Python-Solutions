# problem link: https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-integer-divisible-by-k/


# Description:
"""
Given a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n such that n is divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1.

Return the length of n. If there is no such n, return -1.

Note: n may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 1, which has length 1.
Example 2:

Input: k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2.
Example 3:

Input: k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.
