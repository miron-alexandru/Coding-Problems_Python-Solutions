# problem link: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-subarrays-where-max-element-appears-at-least-k-times/


# Description
"""
You are given an integer array nums and a positive integer k.

Return the number of subarrays where the maximum element of nums appears at least k times in that subarray.

A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,2,3,3], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarrays that contain the element 3 at least 2 times are: [1,3,2,3], [1,3,2,3,3], [3,2,3], [3,2,3,3], [2,3,3] and [3,3].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,4,2,1], k = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: No subarray contains the element 4 at least 3 times.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 106
1 <= k <= 105
