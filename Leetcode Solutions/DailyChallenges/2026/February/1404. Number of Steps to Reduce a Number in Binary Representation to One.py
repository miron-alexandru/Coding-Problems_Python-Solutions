# Description:
"""
Given the binary representation of an integer as a string s, return the number of steps to reduce it to 1 under the following rules:

If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2.

If the current number is odd, you have to add 1 to it.

It is guaranteed that you can always reach one for all test cases.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "1101"
Output: 6
Explanation: "1101" corressponds to number 13 in their decimal representation.
Step 1) 13 is odd, add 1 and obtain 14. 
Step 2) 14 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 7.
Step 3) 7 is odd, add 1 and obtain 8.
Step 4) 8 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 4.  
Step 5) 4 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 2. 
Step 6) 2 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 1.  
Example 2:

Input: s = "10"
Output: 1
Explanation: "10" corresponds to number 2 in their decimal representation.
Step 1) 2 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 1.  
Example 3:

Input: s = "1"
Output: 0

            bit = int(s[i])

            if bit + carry == 1:
                # odd: add 1 then divide
                steps += 2
                carry = 1
            else:
                # even: only divide
                steps += 1

        # If carry remains, we need one extra step
        return steps + carry
