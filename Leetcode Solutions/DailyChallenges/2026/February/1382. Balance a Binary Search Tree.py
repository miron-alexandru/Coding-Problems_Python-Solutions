# problem link: https://leetcode.com/problems/balance-a-binary-search-tree/



# Description:
"""
Given the root of a binary search tree, return a balanced binary search tree with the same node values. If there is more than one answer, return any of them.

A binary search tree is balanced if the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,null]
Output: [2,1,3,null,null,null,4]
Explanation: This is not the only correct answer, [3,1,4,null,2] is also correct.
Example 2:

Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,1,3]
